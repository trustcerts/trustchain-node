# Reset the nodes

Occasionally nodes need to be reset, which means in our case their storage has to be cleaned.

## Clean up 
When the reset process is triggered, all subfolders of the blockchain folder of the node are deleted.
Furthermore the content of the database tables is cleared.

# Open questions
* Is this safe to do while the node is running?
* Are the indexes also reset?

# TODOS
